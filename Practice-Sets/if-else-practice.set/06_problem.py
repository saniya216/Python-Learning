#Write a program to calculate the grade of a student from his marks from the following scheme:
#90 - 100  → Ex
#80 - 90   → A
#70 - 80   → B
#60 - 70   → C
#50 - 60   → D
#Below 50  → F

# Q6. Calculate student's grade.

marks = int(input("Enter your marks: "))

if marks >= 90 and marks <= 100:
    print("Grade: Ex")

elif marks >= 80:
    print("Grade: A")

elif marks >= 70:
    print("Grade: B")

elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade: C")

elif marks >= 50:
    print("Grade: D")

else:
    print("Grade: F")
